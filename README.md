## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
1.Structured Interview Process:Starts with ice-breaking questions. Progresses to in-depth technical and managerial questions based on the candidate's experience and job level.

2.AI-Driven Question Selection:Questions should be dynamically selected based on the candidate's expertise and job role. The system should ensure relevance and avoid bias.

3.Automated Response Evaluation:Responses should be graded based on relevance, clarity, and depth. AI/ML algorithms can analyze semantic correctness and technical accuracy.

4.Scoring Mechanism:Question Relevance Score: How well the expert's questions match the candidateâ€™s field. Response Relevance Score: How well the candidate answers the question. Overall Subject Knowledge Score: A cumulative measure of the candidate's competency.

5.User Experience:Experts and candidates should have a seamless, interactive experience with a simulated boardroom environment. AI assistance should provide feedback and scoring in real-time.

6.Objective Decision Making:Final scoring should aid experts in making unbiased hiring/promotion decisions. Reduces subjectivity and ensures the right talent is selected.
